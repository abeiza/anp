This is an internal update. No new method was introduced. Use set_subgrid() to create multiple subgrids of the same master grid. Previously the later subgrid would overwrite the previous one.     -   Select and Autocomplete  edit types now support read only fields during edit, and only during edit. It doesn't affect during insert new row.+   Bug Fixes:    -   Foreign key filter is now also applied during export master detail grids. This fixes bug that produces the entire details grids when export.    -   Fix a bug that cause width resize to go crazy. It was changed from "100%" to '1000' so that subgrid width is stretched to fit the parent grid. It turns out it's more trouble than it worths.     -   New mobile example+   Misc.:    -   Modified local_array.php to include sort type.    -   Update inline action column, virtual column examples    -   Reverted FORM edit trigger event back to "ondblClickRow" from "onSelectRow" as requested by usersphpGrid 6.2+   Updated advanced example to include date comparison.+   Added set direction function+   Added a better datetimepicker jquery library to pick both date AND time.+   Page now reloads automatically as soon as a selection made in master grid by using “setSelection”.+   add tooltip using jQuery+   Conditional formatting now works with local array!!+   single quote in search and master detail join key value will break the grid. Fixed.+   New example - master detail layout side by side.+   Auto generate SERVER_ROOT value. When NOT using Apache alias directive or IIS virtual directory, phpGrid can successfully generate SERVER_ROOT value using the following script in conf.php. You don’t need to do anything. However, you should set SERVER_ROOT manually when use Apache alias directive or IIS virtual directory. phpGrid 6.1A bug in client side grid object referencing was fixed by using a unique jQuery selector ID and grid object variable name to avoid a naming collision. A 4th parameter was added to the grouping method to hide the grouping column by default. The grid IIS now auto reloaded on FORM edit after submitting. file_upload JavaScript was updated to display corresponding Ajax response in the debug console. A problem where required scripts were not included in an internal function due to execution orders between master and detail grids was fixed. The debug window is now toggled off by default. Two new code samples were added. You can now integrate phpGrid, phpChart and phpAutocomplete seamlessly in your solution! The integration sample code is now available online. phpGrid & phpChart Integration http://phpgrid.com/example/phpgrid-phpchart-integration-with-live-example/ phpGrid & phpAutocomplete Integration http://phpautocomplete.com/examples/phpgrid-integration-experimental/phpGrid 6 This is a major release with many new features and enhancements. New features: composite primary key support, autocomplete control, sortable row, nested/drill-down editable subgrid, a column chooser, Excel mode, global theme and debug, two new great looking premium themes, a new row level permission function, and many bugfixes. The master detail feature has been massively enhanced. In the back-end, this release adds an SQL Server Native driver and DB2 DSN-less connectivity support.- enable_editAdded a 3rd parameter for user defined edit script file name other than the default "edit.php" file. Note that the user defined edit file is NOT automatically passed to detail and subgrid. In most cases, you do not need to use your own edit script rather than simply modify edit.php (requires Enterprise or Universal license for source code).- set_col_dynalinknow works with local array- cls_database.phpdb2-dsnlessNow supports DB2 DSN-less as database type. Thanks, Jon Paris!odbc_mssql_native"odbc_mssql_native" DB_TYPE for SQL Server Native ODBC driver"odbc_mssql" should be used for ***DSN-only connectivity *** on *nix, OS X using unixODBC through FreeTDS.unixODBC requires environment variables in conf.php  putenv("ODBCINSTINI=/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.1/etc/odbcinst.ini");  putenv("ODBCINI=/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.1/etc/odbc.ini");unixODBC is DSN connection only with the following .conf and .ini files. I used Amazon RDS MSSQL instance during testing.   /usr/local/Cellar/freetds/0.91/etc/freetds.conf   # server specific section    [global]    # TDS protocol version    ; tds version = 4.2    # Whether to write a TDSDUMP file for diagnostic purposes    # (setting this to /tmp is insecure on a multi-user system)    ; dump file = /tmp/freetds.log    ; debug flags = 0xffff    # Command and connection timeouts    ; timeout = 10    ; connect timeout = 10    # If you get out-of-memory errors, it may mean that your client    # is trying to allocate a huge buffer for a TEXT field.    # Try setting 'text size' to a more reasonable limit    text size = 64512    [phpgridmssql]    host = phpgridmssql.cbdlprkhjrmd.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com    port = 1433    tds version = 7.0   /usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.1/etc/odbc.ini   [phpgridmssql]    Description = MS SQL Server    Driver = FreeTDS    Server = phpgridmssql.cbdlprkhjrmd.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com    TraceFile = /tmp/sql.log    UID = mssqluser    PWD = PASSWORD    ReadOnly = No    Port = 1433   Database = sampledb   /usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.1/etc/odbcinst.ini   [FreeTDS]    Description = FreeTDS    Driver = /usr/local/Cellar/freetds/0.91/lib/libtdsodbc.so    Setup = /usr/local/Cellar/freetds/0.91/lib/libtdsodbc.so    FileUsage = 1    CPTimeout =    CPResuse =    client charset = utf-8- SQL ServerThe cells with NULL value repeat the value from the previous row has been fixed due to a bug in ADOdb (server/adodb5/adodb.inc.php), our database abstract class library.- before_script_end public variableAdded public variable 'before_script_end'. It can be 'hooked' into the display when ALL the DOM elements are ready.- priviate cust_prop_jsonstr (known as ud_params pre-version six)example: filter_grid_on_pageload.phpNote that the filters must be passed as string to data.php via POST, so not possible to use set_grid_property function which takes only array paramsExample:$dg->cust_prop_jsonstr = 'postData: {filters:                            \'{"groupOp":"AND","rules":[{"field":"status","op":"eq","data":"Shipped"}]}\'},';- set_grid_propertyParameters:$grid_property: An array represents grid property. The property will add to or overwrite existing properties already defined by phpGrid.Description:Advanced method. Set custom datagrid properties. The parameter must be an array. You must be rather familiar jqGrid API in order to take advantage of this method effectively. In most cases, you do not need to use this method. Note that this method is not the same as set_grid_method, another advanced phpGrid method.Example:$dg -> set_grid_property(array('search'=>true));- set_grid_methodIt now takes variable arguments. The changes make the function more flexible with different jqGrid methods with variable arguments. Super useful. :)- INLINE edit improvement:checkbox now display as checkbox,new blank row when add.auto refresh grid after add.WYSIWYG support- set_edit_conditionSet row-level edit condition for edition permission.Note:1. that this works for INLINE ONLY by hiding the edit icons using javascript, CSS2. For that reason, developers should still validate user permission at the database or on the server side.3. In more complicate condition, it's recommended to create your condition at run-timeParameter:     array(column => compare_operand, '&& OR ||', column2 => compare_operand, '&& OR ||'.....)Usage example:     $dg->enable_edit('INLINE', 'CRUD')->set_edit_condition(array('status'=>'!="Shipped"', '&&', 'customerNumber'=>'==129' ));Example of generated javascript conditon:     if $column = "status", $compare_operand = " == 'Shipped'", then it ouputs: if($("#orders").jqGrid("getCell", rowId, "status") == "Shipped"){Example file: custom_edit_conditon.php- Composite PK support (Enterprise+)This is a major feature in version 6. Lots of development resources devoted to support composite PK, and yet making it simple at the same time. In stead of passing a single string variable in the constructor as the primary key, you can now pass an array of strings as the composite primary key. For a single primary key, you can still use a string or an array with a single string value. e.g.http://phpgrid.com/example/composite-primary-key-support/Note that composite PK is not supported for foreign key referencial in master/detail and subgrid.- set_col_edittypeUse index number 0 and 1 instead of column name to retrieve data value in "select" edit type. This allows more complex SQL statement such as CONCAT.- Conditional formatFixed bug in subgrid due to "+" column- set_masterdetailThe 2rd parameter is finally working as intended. It no longer has to be the same name as the master primary key. It was never implemented.√ç- New premium themes!

Wordpress uses DB_NAME variable.phpGrid 5.5.5This release addresses a few bugs and added a number of new features. The ODBC generic driver is now supported, as it works better in Unix environments for some databases such as MS SQL. A set_grid_method function was added. jqGrid 4.4.5, jQuery 1.9.0, and jQuery UI 1.10 are now supported. Column freeze is now supported. File upload can now be activated with a double click on a row in form edit mode. Minor bugs were fixed. phpGrid 5.5.2File uploading now works when adding new a record. Conditional format is now working with rows without a preexisting cell format. Subgrid now supports filter methods.phpGrid 5.5.1This is a patch release. It fixes an array index out of bound bug in the set edittype function. It removes control validation logic for master/detail INLINE mode since this is no longer a limitation. It removes a redundant include statement in the datagrid class that was causing unnecessary errors in some systems. phpGrid 5.51. advanced search is now supported in detail grid2. now support array parameter in set_col_dynalinks.It's also backward compatible.    $dynaParam (old $idName) can be a string or an array width dynamic value    $addParam are parameters with static value3. display_script_includeonce scope is now public (better MVC framework compability)    $dg->display_script_includeonce(true);4. better Oracle database support    define(PHPGRID_DB_TYPE, 'oci805');5. updated to latest ADOdb library 5.1.86. added toolbar search dropdown support7. phpChart integration example added!8.
